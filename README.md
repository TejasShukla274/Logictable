# Logictable
It is a logic system based on discrete mathematic and digital systems
The logics used are mentioned below 

Logical operators AND, OR, NOT are used in condition checking. Like a AND b checks if both a and b are true. a OR b checks if either of a or b is true. !a complements the boolean value of a.

In this question you basically need to do
a && b
a || b

Input: a = false, b = true
Output: false true true
Explanation: false AND true gives false. false OR true gives true. NOT false give true.
